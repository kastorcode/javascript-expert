This project explores various creational design patterns implemented in JavaScript, the focus is on demonstrating how these patterns can be effectively utilized to create objects in a flexible and reusable manner.

### Project Structure

The project is divided into three main directories, each representing a different creational design pattern:

1. **Factory Pattern** (`01-factory`)
   - Contains implementations of the Factory design pattern.
   - `src/`: Contains the source code for the factory implementations.
   - `test/`: Includes tests for the factory implementations.

2. **Abstract Factory Pattern** (`02-abstract-factory`)
   - Demonstrates the Abstract Factory design pattern.
   - `platforms/`: Contains platform-specific implementations.
   - `shared/`: Includes shared components across platforms.
   - `ui/`: Contains user interface components.

3. **Test Data Builder / Object Mother Pattern** (`03-test-data-builder-object-mother`)
   - Implements the Test Data Builder and Object Mother design patterns.
   - `src/`: Contains the source code for the test data builders.
   - `test/`: Includes tests for the test data builders.

### Installation

To install the dependencies for each pattern, navigate to the respective directory and run:

```bash
npm i
```

### Usage

Each directory contains its own implementations and tests, you can run the tests using:

```bash
npm t
```
