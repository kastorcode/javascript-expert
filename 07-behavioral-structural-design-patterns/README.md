This repository contains implementations of various behavioral and structural design patterns in JavaScript. The goal is to provide clear examples and explanations of each pattern to aid in understanding and applying these concepts in software development.

### Project Structure

The `behavioral` directory includes the following design patterns:

- **01. Strategy**: Implements the Strategy pattern, allowing the selection of algorithms at runtime;
- **02. Observer**: Demonstrates the Observer pattern, enabling a subscription mechanism to allow multiple objects to listen and react to events;
- **03. Template Method**: Shows the Template Method pattern, defining the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses.

The `structural` directory contains the following design patterns:

- **04. Decorator/Middleware**: Implements the Decorator pattern, allowing behavior to be added to individual objects, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class;
- **05. Adapter**: Demonstrates the Adapter pattern, allowing incompatible interfaces to work together by wrapping an existing class with a new interface.
