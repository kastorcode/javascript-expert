### Content

The `01-benchmarking` folder compares two different implementations that solve the same problem.

The `02-memory-leak` folder explores how to detect and prevent memory leaks in JavaScript applications.
- **01-example-heap**: Example of Node.js heap memory overflow error;
- **02-memory-leak-events**: Demonstrates how to look for memory leaks using `climem` for real-time heap memory monitoring, `autocannon` for performing multiple HTTP requests, and the `0x` and `clinic` libraries for generating HTML flame graphs;
- **03-cluster-nodejs**: It uses the Node.js `cluster` module to create an orchestrator and, for each CPU core, a web server instance, increasing responsiveness, furthermore, whenever a worker is terminated, a new one is automatically created.
