### 👨‍🎓 Main Learnings

- **Automated Testing**: Implementation of unit, integration and end-to-end tests to ensure code quality and reliability.
- **JavaScript Lifecycle**: In-depth understanding of the lifecycle, including concepts such as Prototype Chaining, Type Coercion, and Call Stack, which are fundamental for optimization and debugging.
- **Advanced Data Types**: Mastery of structures such as Map, Set, WeakMap and WeakSet, as well as Generators and Iterators, expanding the capacity to manipulate complex data.
- **Regular Expressions (RegEx)**: Application of regular expressions for text validation and processing, using the Fluent API design pattern for building operations pipelines.
- **Design Patterns**: Implementation of design patterns such as Singleton, Factory and Observer, promoting more modular, reusable and easy-to-maintain code.
- **Package Management with NPM**: Creating and managing packages, understanding semantic versioning, and best practices for publishing and maintaining libraries.
- **Command Line Interfaces (CLI)**: Developing CLI applications with Node.js, including file manipulation and safe execution of shell commands.
- **Streams in Node.js**: Work efficiently with data streams, optimizing read and write operations for better performance in high-demand applications.
- **Error Handling**: Adoption of best practices for capturing and managing exceptions, ensuring resilience and facilitating application debugging.
- **Performance Optimization**: Analysis and performance improvement in JavaScript and Node.js applications, focusing on profiling techniques and bottleneck identification.
- **Long-Running Processing**: Using Worker Threads and Child Processes to handle intensive tasks without blocking the event loop.
- **JavaScript Security**: Implementing security practices to mitigate common vulnerabilities such as code injection and XSS attacks.
